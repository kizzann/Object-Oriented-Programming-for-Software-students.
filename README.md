## This depository exists for my next course I will be doing

### I am 24, and I am currently working while I am going to school. I am in the Army National Guard, and I love to play sports

#### I am taking this course to get into software developement, and to also get my foot in the door for coding. Eventually I want to get into python, and possibly C++ but the end goal is to hopefully build my own company and write my own unique line of code and use it for good
